# Web-Scraper

Vision for this project somewhat unclear. I want to develop a site that is versatile in that you can scrape the web, or use it as a 'safe' browser.

## Features currently

The site can go to a URL and grab a screenshot of the page, or it can grab HTML from a given URL and strip it of any potentially dangerous content (scripts, images, and links so far)

## Plans for the overall aesthetic

I want the site to look as though it is a laptop (or phone or tablet depending on users screen size) you are viewing it through, and maybe simulate how a Mac or Windows device would look if you opened Chrome.
